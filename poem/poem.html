  <h1>Exercise Science, Movement, and Motivation</h1>

<p>
  I am an exercise science major who is passionate about health, movement,
  and physical activity. Studying exercise science has helped me understand
  how the body responds to exercise and why staying active is so important
  for both physical and mental well-being. One of my favorite ways to stay
  active is <strong>running</strong>, which helps me stay focused, energized,
  and consistent.

<h2>My Interests and Motivation</h2>

<p>
  Music plays a big role in my workouts because it keeps me motivated and
  makes exercise more enjoyable.<br>
  I also love spending time at the beach, where being active feels relaxing
  and refreshing. My favorite color is <em>purple</em>, which I associate
  with creativity and calm energy&nbsp;&nbsp;especially during recovery days.
